== Description ==

[MuCash] is micropayments made simple.  Our plugin lets your readers support

as a single penny.

            "MuCash, micropayments simplified."
            
This version of our plugin offers the following features:

* **Paid articles**: Set a price on articles of your choosing.  Users will only
see an excerpt and have the option to purchase the full article.
* **Paid media downloads**: Quickly and easily add a button to any post or
page to let your users purchase media files from you, be an e-book, PDF, or MP3.
* **Donations in comments**: In addition to leaving a "kudos", your readers can
choose to leave a donation in any ammount from a penny to a dollar.
* **Per-post donations**: If you use an external comment system like Disqus, the
above option won't work for you, but you can also accept per-post donations
via a simple donate button.

MuCash is a small company based in New York City. We are committed to 
providing you with all the features and support you need, so please do not

== Installation ==

Installing the mucash plugin is easy.  You can upload the .zip file, or just
search and install it from the Plugin Directory via the Plugins page in your
Wordpress admin panel.

You will need to sign up for a MuCash publisher account.  This is easy and takes
only a couple of minutes:

http://mucash.com/account/sites/add

Once you sign up, and add your website, you'll receive a Site ID and API key.
Just paste them into the corresponding fields on the "MuCash" page of your
WordPress admin panel, and you're all set.

Users will automatically be able to leave donations along with comments on
your blog posts.  When you edit a post, you also have the option to require
a payment to unlock the full article.  To do this,

1. Type your post as you normally would.
2. Set a price for the post.  This can be done by selecting a price from the 
drop down menu in the MuCash options box on the post edit page.
3. Add a "more" break in the post.  This is where the MuCash button will appear 
in your post.  The rest of the post wonâ€™t be visible until the reader purchases 
the rest of the post.

Please contact us at info@mucash.com if you have any questions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why micropayments? =
Creating quality content takes effort, and we believe that the people who create
value should get fairly rewareded, whether through voluntary donations or
direct purchases.  Subscriptions are one way for readers to directly purchase
your content, but lock out most casual users because they may only be interested
in one article.  A single ten cent purchase can easily exceed the avertising
revenue generated by hundreds of page views.

Our mission is to allow writers to focus on doing what they do best: writing,
researching, and creating quality content.

= Yes, but why would I want donations of just a few cents? =
Most people can't afford to  leave several dollars every time they enjoy a
post you created, or want to show appreciation.  All too often they'll plan on
leaving a donation "later".  MuCash enables transactions as small as a penny,
so they truly can reward the author every time they find something they like
without putting it off or thinking too hard about it.

= Do I have to put all my posts behind a paywall? =

No, you set prices individually on articles.  For example, you could keep the
bulk of your posts free but only charge for a few feature articles.
Alternatively, you can opt to keep all your content free and only use the
donation feature.

= Do I need a credit card merchant account? =

No, we handle all credit card transactions with end users.  When they sign up,
they will be prompted to purchase credits using a credit card.  They can use
purchased credits across all MuCash-enabled websites.

= How do I get paid? =

We will transfer money into a checking account of your choosing once a month.
You can specify your banking details on the settings page of your account on
MuCash.com.  For more details, including our commission rates, please see the 
full terms and conditions on our website, and shown during the sign up process.

= Who is behind MuCash? =

MuCash is founded by Vinay Pai, and Ben Oaks.  You can read more about us 
on our website here:  https://mucash.com/about-us/

== Screenshots ==

1. Setting a price on an article from the edit post window in the admin dashboard. 
2. The user sees and excerpt (the porting before more tag) and a button to buy the 
full article.
3. A window allows them to confirm pricing and verify their intent to purchase.
They will then be instantly taken to the full article, with minimal disruption
of their browsing experience.
4. Users can also choose to leave a donation along with their comments.
